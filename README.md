## Tools and Libraries

This project leverages the following technologies:
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **PyTorch/TensorFlow**: For model development and training.
- **Albumentations**: For advanced image augmentation techniques.
- **DVC (Data Version Control)**: To manage data pipelines and track experiments.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For visualizing model performance.
- **ONNX**: For exporting models to an interoperable format.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application for deployment.

## Dataset

The pipeline is designed to work with custom image datasets organized in the following structure:
```bash
dataset/
├── train/
│   ├── class_1/
│   │   ├── image_1.jpg
│   │   ├── image_2.jpg
│   ├── class_2/
│       ├── image_3.jpg
│       ├── image_4.jpg
├── val/
│   ├── class_1/
│   ├── class_2/
├── test/
    ├── class_1/
    ├── class_2/

## Key Fields
- **Class Labels**: Each folder represents a distinct class for classification.
- **Image Files**: Images should be stored in standard formats such as `.jpg` or `.png`.

## Example
For a binary classification task (e.g., cats vs. dogs), the dataset structure may look like this:
   dataset/
   ├── train/
   │   ├── cats/
   │   │   ├── cat_1.jpg
   │   │   ├── cat_2.jpg
   │   ├── dogs/
   │       ├── dog_1.jpg
   │       ├── dog_2.jpg
   ├── val/
   │   ├── cats/
   │   ├── dogs/
   ├── test/
       ├── cats/
       ├── dogs/



## Dataset Preprocessing
- **Training Set**: Used for model training and optimization.
- **Validation Set**: Used for fine-tuning hyperparameters and monitoring overfitting.
- **Test Set**: Reserved for final evaluation of model performance.

## Additional Notes
- The dataset should be balanced across classes to avoid bias during training.
- Augmentation techniques such as flipping, cropping, and rotation can be applied to increase the dataset size and improve generalization.
